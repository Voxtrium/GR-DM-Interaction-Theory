When energy is free to move, it doesn’t spread out—it squeezes itself into the smallest surface that can still dump the same power.
You see it in a candle: the real burning happens in a paper-thin skin, and the combined heat from convection and radiation funnels 
through a tight hotspot near the tip. Knock the flame sideways or crank up the fuel and the hotspot widens for a moment, then re-collapses 
into a compact core. Scale the fire from match to refinery flare and the total power can rise hundreds-fold while the hotspot’s area grows 
only modestly. We propose this “collapse-to-minimal-area” rule is a universal optimizer built into dissipative physics: any system—flames, 
plasmas, even horizon-scale flows—reshapes itself to maximize energy release per unit active surface. Measuring how that collapse behaves 
under different conditions lets us test whether this geometric optimization is a fundamental law rather than just a combustion quirk.
