

K_eff(t) = K_s - η σ²(t) - ζ θ²(t)
Fragmentation: K_eff < K_c
Locking: K_eff > K_c

Phase 1 (0-620 days): No radio = fragmentation phase (K_eff < K_c)
Phase 2 (620+ days): Radio brightening = locking phase (K_eff > K_c)

Helicity Growth Mechanism
helicity density h = v·ω with:
L_shell = -½ ρ_s v² - η σ² - κ h

Twist field S(x) with characteristic gradient |∇S| sets a scale:
v_a = ℓ D_a S → characteristic velocity
→ sets characteristic density/field scales

Skyrme Stabilization
 β term preventing vortex collapse:
L_lock ≈ -(K_s/2)(∇S)² - (β/4)(ε^{abc} D_a S D_b S)²

Stellarator Analogy
The "zones of maximum geometric shear" where |ε^{abc} D_a S D_b S| peaks should be where fragmentation is strongest. The delayed, non-uniform TDE emission could reflect this, but it's not definitive.

Model Prediction: Black hole horizons convert accreting matter into dark matter fragments via BKT-like topological transitions, while simultaneously templating magnetic field organization in electromagnetic outflows.
Late-Time Spectral Index Stability - After ~100 days, α stabilizes due to horizon-templated magnetic structure
Anti-Correlated Polarization-Flux Evolution
Polarization RISES while flux FALLS (horizon drives field ordering)

Two-Phase Evolution

Phase 1 (0-100 days): Fragmentation active, chaotic fields, normal νa evolution
Phase 2 (>100 days): Horizon ordering dominates, field organizes, spectral stability

Energy Budget with "Missing" Energy

Prediction: ~10-30% of accreted energy goes to invisible dark matter fragments
Observable: Total radiated energy less than available accretion energy by this fraction

Fundamental Fields on Stretched Horizon H
Geometric quantities:

h_ab: Induced metric on horizon
K_ab: Extrinsic curvature
σ_ab = K_ab - ½θh_ab: Shear tensor
θ = K^c_c: Expansion scalar

Physical fields:

C(x): Core compression field [energy density]
S(x): Twist field (2π-periodic scalar)
F^a = νω^a: Tangential vector field
ω^a = ε^{abc}D_b u_c: Vorticity of horizon 2-velocity
v_a = ℓD_a S: Velocity field from twist gradient

Helicity density:
h = v_a ω^a = ℓ(D_a S)ω^a
Energy decomposition:
E² = (mc²)² + (pc)²
Where:
m = E_core/c² = (1/c²)∫_{V_core} C(x) d³x
pc = ∫_{V_shell} κ v·ω d³x
Core Lagrangian: L_core = -C - α_C(∇C)²/Λ_C²
Shell Lagrangian: L_shell = -½ρ_s v_a v^a - ησ² - ζθ² - κh
Locking Lagrangian (BKT sector): L_lock = -(K_s/2)(D_a S)(D^a S) - (β/4)(ε^{abc}D_a S D_b S)²
Fragmentation Criterion
Effective stiffness: K_eff(t) = K_s - ησ²(t) - ζθ²(t)
Fragmentation phase: K_eff < K_c → vortex unbinding → dark matter production
Locked phase: K_eff > K_c → ordered state → electromagnetic emission

Key Parameters:
K_s Twist stiffnes senergy/area
K_c Critical stiffness threshold energy/area
κ Helicity coupling strength mass×length/time
β Skyrme term strength energy×length² 
η Shear viscosity mass/(length×time)
ζ Bulk viscosity mass/(length×time) 
ℓ Characteristic twist scale length 
ν Vorticity stiffness scale energy/area


TDE evolution timescales:
K_eff(t) = K_s[1 - A·exp(-t/τ_shear) - B·(Ṁ/Ṁ_Edd)]
Helicity evolution:
h(t) = h_0[Ṁ(t)/Ṁ_peak]^α[1 - exp(-t/τ_h)]
Fragment mass scale:
M_frag ≈ K_s ℓ_vortex²/c²
Where ℓ_vortex ≈ √(β/K_s) sets the vortex core size.

Physical Interpretation

Mass arises from compression (C field integral)
Momentum arises from helical twist (v·ω integral)
Dark matter forms when K_eff < K_c (vortex unbinding)
Radio emission grows when K_eff > K_c (field ordering)
Energy conservation: E² = m²c⁴ + p²c² emerges as Noether charge


This formalism unifies dark matter production with electromagnetic emission from black holes via topological transitions on the stretched horizon.
