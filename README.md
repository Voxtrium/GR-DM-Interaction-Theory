Pretty much just spent some time exploring possible methods to fix our current physics back onto our cosmological observations. Came up with this. I can't really prove it though, it is outside my capability, 
so if someone else has the will and desire to help I would love to know, does it work within our current cosmological observations and constraints?
------The idea------
Overview
OuruO Gravitation reimagines a “singularity” as a rigid, low‑entropy crystal formed by a confining dark‑QCD sector. Inside black holes this crystal persists and then decays via Hawking radiation—providing the very portal by which we observe dark matter’s effects in the cosmos.
By weaving together black‑hole microphysics, dark‑matter self‑interactions, and a subtle drift in gravitational coupling, this unified picture captures phenomena that General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics address only separately. If borne out by data, it offers a more cohesive and predictive framework for our universe. 
(The OuruO formula and overview PDF are public on the repo)

I believe what needs to happen next is we need to run a SIDM test to see if the variables can all be expressed in the formula without breaking observational constraints, if it does then we can go from there.
