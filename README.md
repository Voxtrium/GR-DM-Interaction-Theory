A single idea that links black-hole horizons, dark-matter behavior, and the cosmic “dark energy” push by treating every black hole’s horizon as a thin, twisty membrane that slowly feeds energy back into the universe.
-----
How to picture it
-----
Black holes aren’t perfect voids – their horizons act like active skins that can store and leak energy.

Tiny “vortex grains” on that skin behave like dark-matter particles once they pop off.

The more horizon area the universe builds (through new black holes and mergers), the more the vacuum energy drifts—giving a gentle late-time push that we normally call dark energy.

Three stiffness knobs built into the membrane decide all of that:

how heavy each grain is,

how strongly those grains bump into each other,

and a tiny twist that future gravitational-wave detectors could notice.
--------------------
Why it hasn’t failed yet
First pass through galaxy and black-hole data shows the allowed window for those three knobs is not already ruled out.

Energy bookkeeping and stability checks pass on paper—no hidden infinities popped out.

It falls back to ordinary ΛCDM when horizons stop growing, so it can’t wreck Big-Bang nucleosynthesis or the CMB.

What still has to be proven (and needs help)
Open job and Why it matters
Model the real black-hole population	We need a number for “how much new horizon area per year” to turn the idea into an exact curve for dark-energy drift using the comoving horizon volume
Plug the drift curve into a cosmology code (e.g. CLASS)	To see if supernova & BAO data actually prefer this over vanilla ΛCDM.
Compare the built-in dark-matter self-interaction to dwarf-galaxy data	If the predicted bumping strength is outside 0.1–3 cm²/g, the theory is dead.
Look for the tiny twist in black-hole ring-down waves	Should shift the main tone by <1 %—future LIGO/LISA runs could catch it.


Why bother?
If these four tests pass, we get one framework that:

explains why dark matter interacts a bit but not too much,

makes dark energy evolve instead of being a magic constant,

and does it without adding dozens of new particles or forces.

If any one test fails, the idea is falsified—clear win–win.
