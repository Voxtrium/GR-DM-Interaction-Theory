A single idea that links black-hole horizons, dark-matter behavior, and the cosmic “dark energy” push by treating every black hole’s horizon as a thin, twisty membrane that slowly feeds energy back into the universe.
-----
How to picture it
-----
Black holes aren’t perfect voids – their horizons act like active skins that can store and leak energy.

Tiny “vortex grains” on that skin behave like dark-matter particles once they pop off.

The more horizon area the universe builds (through new black holes and mergers), the more the vacuum energy drifts—giving a gentle late-time push that we normally call dark energy.

Three stiffness knobs built into the membrane decide all of that:

how heavy each grain is,

how strongly those grains bump into each other,

and a tiny twist that future gravitational-wave detectors could notice.
--------------------
Why it hasn’t failed yet
First pass through galaxy and black-hole data shows the allowed window for those three knobs is not already ruled out.

Energy bookkeeping and stability checks pass on paper—no hidden infinities popped out.

It falls back to ordinary ΛCDM when horizons stop growing, so it can’t wreck Big-Bang nucleosynthesis or the CMB.

What still has to be proven (and needs help)
Open job	Why it matters
Model the real black-hole population	We need a number for “how much new horizon area per year” to turn the idea into an exact curve for dark-energy drift.
Plug the drift curve into a cosmology code (e.g. CLASS)	To see if supernova & BAO data actually prefer this over vanilla ΛCDM.
Compare the built-in dark-matter self-interaction to dwarf-galaxy data	If the predicted bumping strength is outside 0.1–3 cm²/g, the theory is dead.
Look for the tiny twist in black-hole ring-down waves	Should shift the main tone by <1 %—future LIGO/LISA runs could catch it.


Why bother?
If these four tests pass, we get one framework that:

explains why dark matter interacts a bit but not too much,

makes dark energy evolve instead of being a magic constant,

and does it without adding dozens of new particles or forces.

If any one test fails, the idea is falsified—clear win–win.

A candle or lighter flame is mostly hollow.
The real burning happens in a paper-thin outer “skin” where hot fuel vapour meets fresh air.

Temperature alone is not what lights kindling.
The blue base of that skin is the hottest spot, but the tip of the flame moves the greatest amount of hot gas through the smallest opening. That makes the tip the place with the strongest overall heat punch.

The flame seems to arrange itself so that this maximum heat flux sits at the tip, no matter the exact fuel or small gusts of air.
If that always happens, the flame is behaving like a simple optimiser: it shapes itself to dump energy as fast as possible, much the way water finds the steepest route downhill.

How we test it
Collect video and temperature data
• Record steady flames with a thermal camera or a phone at 60 fps (exposure locked).
• Capture two runs: still air and low-speed fan.

Find the hot-flux zone
• Frame-by-frame, track the hottest pixels and sum their brightness or thermal reading through horizontal slices.
• Plot where the largest heat flux sits: near the base, half-way up, or at the tip.

Add a quick calorimeter check
• Hang a thin copper disk 10 mm above the base and another at the tip.
• Use a cheap thermocouple on each disk. The disk that climbs faster in temperature is in the stronger heat stream.

Repeat with small changes
• Swap fuels (candle wax, butane).
• Tilt the flame or add a side gust.
• See if the peak heat zone follows the geometric tip or jumps somewhere else.

Interpret the outcome
• If the peak heat zone keeps locking onto the tip, even when the flame shape deforms, that supports the “self-optimising heat-dump” idea.
• If it drifts unpredictably, the optimiser picture needs revision.
