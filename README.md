Pretty much just spent some time exploring possible methods to fix our current physics back onto our cosmological observations. Came up with this. I can't really prove it though, it is outside my capability, 
so if someone else has the will and desire to help I would love to know, does it work within our current cosmological observations and constraints?
------The idea------
Overview
OuruO Gravitation reimagines a “singularity” as a rigid, low‑entropy crystal formed by a confining dark‑QCD sector. Inside black holes this crystal persists and then decays via Hawking radiation—providing the very portal by which we observe dark matter’s effects in the cosmos.
By weaving together black‑hole microphysics, dark‑matter self‑interactions, and a subtle drift in gravitational coupling, this unified picture captures phenomena that General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics address only separately. If borne out by data, it offers a more cohesive and predictive framework for our universe. 
(The OuruO formula and overview PDF are public on the repo)

I believe what needs to happen next is we need to run a SIDM test to see if the variables can all be expressed in the formula without breaking observational constraints, if it does then we can go from there.

Falsifiable predictions

Dark‑matter self‑interactions: it fixes the velocity‑dependent cross‑section σₜ(v) via the dilaton–baryon coupling. If clusters or dwarfs show σₜ/m outside the 0.1–1 cm²/g window, the model is ruled out.

GW vs EM siren distances: it predicts a 0.3–0.7 % amplitude split by z≈1. Upcoming LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA standard‑siren catalogs (and future LISA/ET) will confirm or falsify that.

BAO & local 𝐺̇/G bounds: it requires |ΔH/H|<0.5 % at z∈[0.2,0.7] and |α_M(0)|≲10⁻². Current BAO surveys and pulsar/solar‑system tests already probe this regime.

Within our reach
All these checks involve:

Solving the Schrödinger equation for a Yukawa potential (partial waves or validated fits).

Numerically integrating the φ (σ) background to get α_M(z).

Comparing to publicly available data from galaxy‑cluster dynamics, CMB+BAO, and GW‑EM siren catalogs.

Because every free parameter is tied to the dark‑QCD inputs (Λ_D, N_f, …), there’s no hidden knob left to turn—if any one of these observables fails to match, the theory is decisively falsified

My two cents, the idea is correct but the math needs help. Unfortunately improving the latter is above my capbilities.
