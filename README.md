A single idea that links black-hole horizons, dark-matter behavior, and the cosmic “dark energy” push by treating every black hole’s horizon as a thin, twisty membrane that slowly feeds energy back into the universe.
-----
How to picture it
-----
Black holes aren’t perfect voids – their horizons act like active skins that can store and leak energy.

Tiny “vortex grains” on that skin behave like dark-matter particles once they pop off.

The more horizon area the universe builds (through new black holes and mergers), the more the vacuum energy drifts—giving a gentle late-time push that we normally call dark energy.

Three stiffness knobs built into the membrane decide all of that:

how heavy each grain is,

how strongly those grains bump into each other,

and a tiny twist that future gravitational-wave detectors could notice.
--------------------
Why it hasn’t failed yet
First pass through galaxy and black-hole data shows the allowed window for those three knobs is not already ruled out.

Energy bookkeeping and stability checks pass on paper—no hidden infinities popped out.

It falls back to ordinary ΛCDM when horizons stop growing, so it can’t wreck Big-Bang nucleosynthesis or the CMB.

New interpertation of light bending!
---
Energy paths optimize across a density gradient in the vacuum field. And flipping the gradient flips whether passes converge or diverge.
---
Think of how light interacts with hot vs cold objects. Rn it's light changes because the mediums refractive index changed. 
But in my model one would instead say that hot vs cold light converges or diverges based on the density gradient. 
And hot vs cold would be an extremely low tech example of inverting the gradient for how light is interacting.




Why it matters

Model the real black-hole population	We need a number for “how much new horizon area per year” to turn the idea into an exact curve for dark-energy drift using the comoving horizon volume

Plug the drift curve into a cosmology code (e.g. CLASS)	To see if supernova & BAO data actually prefer this over vanilla ΛCDM.

Compare the built-in dark-matter self-interaction to dwarf-galaxy data	If the predicted bumping strength is outside 0.1–3 cm²/g, the theory is dead.

Look for the tiny twist in black-hole ring-down waves	Should shift the main tone by <1 %—future LIGO/LISA runs could catch it.


Why bother?
If these four tests pass, we get one framework that:

explains why dark matter interacts a bit but not too much,

makes dark energy evolve instead of being a magic constant,

and does it without adding dozens of new particles or forces.

If any one test fails, the idea is falsified—clear win–win.

Predictions:

A TDE event is more polarized when cooler, less polarized when hotter.

As a TDE brightens, it hardens faster than a constant‑area blackbody; as it fades, it softens faster.

Expect longer hard–soft lags near peak, shrinking as the TDE fades.

Velocity‑dependent SIDM curve fixed by the micro size.

Core sizes track velocity dispersion across halos.

Departures from ΛCDM should track the cosmic BH mass‑growth and merger history.


Color–polarization–flux triplet.
A single event should follow $,p\propto F^{-\gamma(1+\alpha)},$ and $,p\propto T_{\rm eff}^{-4\gamma},$ at fixed viewing angle. 
This gives a three‑way diagnostic: if observations show $,p$ dropping while both $F$ and $T_{\rm eff}$ rise, if we are in the high‑$,\tau,$, then its a collapse‑dominated branch; if not, geometry changes must be dominating $,f_{\rm geom}$.
