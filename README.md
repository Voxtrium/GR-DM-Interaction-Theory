Pretty much just spent some time exploring possible methods to fix our current physics back onto our cosmological observations. Came up with this. I can't really prove it though, it is outside my capability, 
so if someone else has the will and desire to help I would love to know, does it work within our current cosmological observations and constraints?
------The idea------
The entire idea is that a singularity is actually the lowest possible entropy crystal. This crystal decays via hawking radiation but importantly is also our direct measureable interaction with dark matter. 
If this formula is correct it would indicate that within current cosmic understanding and observations that it is a better approximation of our universe than General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics alone. 
(The OuruO formula and overview PDF are public on the repo)
I should add that I believe what I put here today contains about 70% of the answer to connecting General relativity and Quantum Mechanics, its close but with some help from someone experienced I bet it can get there
